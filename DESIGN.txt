/*
 For getCurrentImage() I put it both in Background.java and Entity.java because it contained "blank instanceof class"
 which had it for either. So I deleted those lines so that the instanceof matched the right class.

 I put the createBlacksmith and all the rest until createVien(top to bottom order) to Point instead of
 Entity, however it could go either way. Yet, I chose Point because the class was contained in the parameter.

 In some classes, I reused ORE_KEY because that class contained a method that required it to function. I believe I
 used it on both Entity and WorldModel.

 I put createAnimationAction and createActivityAction in Entity rather than Action because it's parameter contained
 Entity.

 Also, I set adjacent within Point since it behaved more like a point.
